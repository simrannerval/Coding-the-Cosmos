In this project, we're going to introduce you to the one that helped Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz detect the very first one in 1995! This is the **radial velocity** method.\n","\n","You probably know that the planets in the Solar System orbit the Sun. But you might also have heard Isaac Newton's third law: for every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction. Gravity pulls the Earth toward the Sun, but it also pulls the Sun toward the Earth (though because the Sun is a lot more massive than the Earth, this \"reaction\" is incredibly small). In reality, then, the planets in the Solar System don't orbit the Sun — the planets *and the Sun* all orbit the system's **center of mass**. This point in space is found by taking the average position of each body, but taking the weighted average of each of their positions by how massive they are, just like calculating the course grades. Since the Sun is so much more massive than anything else in the Solar system, **the center of mass is actually inside the Sun's surface** — but it's *not* at the Sun's center.\n","\n","This cartoon demonstrates the center of mass of the Sun and the Earth, alone — you could imagine a similar picture with all the planets in the solar system, which would also show the center of mass to be slightly off from the Sun's center.\n","\n","<figure>\n","<img src=\"https://cdn.britannica.com/76/2476-004-E2A5C6F3.jpg\" width=\"500\"\n","    alt=\"Diagram demonstrating center of mass\" />\n","<figcaption>The centre of mass of the two-body Earth-Sun system.\n","© Encyclopædia Britannica</figcaption>\n","</figure>\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"QmFd-pvTJBi8"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Radial Velocity\n","\n","As a result, the Sun wobbles around the center of mass! For the Solar System, this effect is pretty small — the closer and more massive something is, the stronger its gravity, and our most massive planets (Jupiter and Saturn) are far from the Sun. Back in the '90s, Mayor and Queloz were surprised to find that some stars like our Sun have planets around them that are as massive as Jupiter but orbit much, *much* closer in. Because of this, the force of gravity from the planet acting on the star is much stronger, and the star wobbles significantly as it orbits around the system's center of mass.\n","\n","Mayor and Queloz were able to detect the wobblings of a star with a planet around it. They were looking at a system called 51 Pegasi (or \"51 Peg\" for short). They studied the **radial velocity** (or \"RV\") of this system's star. Imagine you are on Earth watching the star from afar, the radial velocity  tells us how fast an object is moving toward or away from us; the RV of an object is positive when it's moving toward us and negative when it's moving away.\n","\n","<figure>\n","<a title=\"European Southern Observatory, CC BY 4.0 &lt;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0&gt;, via Wikimedia Commons\" href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_radial_velocity_method_(artist%E2%80%99s_impression).jpg\"><img width=\"512\" alt=\"The radial velocity method (artist’s impression)\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/The_radial_velocity_method_%28artist%E2%80%99s_impression%29.jpg/512px-The_radial_velocity_method_%28artist%E2%80%99s_impression%29.jpg?20200513023544\"></a>\n","<figcaption>Blueshift and Redshift positions when a star wobles. <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_radial_velocity_method_(artist%E2%80%99s_impression).jpg\">European Southern Observatory</a>, <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0\">CC BY 4.0</a>, via Wikimedia Commons</figcaption>\n","</figure>\n","\n","We can tell how quickly something is moving toward or away from us based on the light it emits — when it's moving toward us, that light looks more blue than it would if it were still; when it's moving away, the light looks more red.\n","\n","\n","Recall the **Doppler effect**: when something like an ambulance with a siren approaches you, the sound waves have\n","a higher pitch (higher frequency), but if it is moving away, the sound waves have a lower pitch (lower frequency).
