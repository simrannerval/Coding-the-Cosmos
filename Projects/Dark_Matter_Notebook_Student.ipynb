Like almost all foundational discoveries in astronomy, the existence of dark matter became evident through observation, and not from theoretical research.\n","\n","While [Vera Rubin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vera_Rubin) first found the conclusive evidence of dark matter by studying the rotation curve of galaxies (which we will be doing too in this notebook!) in $1970$<sup>1</sup>, the idea is not new.\n","\n","![Coma Cluster](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/Coma_cluster_leo.jpg/2560px-Coma_cluster_leo.jpg \"Coma Cluster\")\n","\n","*Photo of the Coma Cluster*\n","\n","\n","The first inkling of its existence came from [Fritz Zwicky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_Zwicky) in $1933$ <sup>2</sup>. Zwicky was studying the beautiful Coma Cluster, specifically the motions of its constituent galaxies at that time. Galaxies, like our galaxy, the Milky Way, are collections of stars (and the planets that orbit around them), as well as vast clouds of gas and dust, all held together by gravity. You've almost certainly seen pictures of beautiful [spiral galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_galaxy) with their swriling arms of dark gas where new stars are forming. Once this gas is used up to form stars, you get an [Elliptical galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptical_galaxy) without the striking spiral arms. A galaxy cluster, as the name suggests, is simply a cluster of many galaxies! Zwicky had a means of measuring the kinetic energy of various galaxies in the Coma Cluster system, and if you have taken physics classes by now, you know that the *kinetic energy* (energy of a moving body) of an object is simply: $\\frac{1}{2} m v^2$, where $m$ is the mass and $v$ is the speed of the object.\n","\n","Another type of energy is *potential energy*.  You can think of potential energy as the energy stored in an object giving it the *potential* to move.  Once that object begins moving, all the stored up potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. Specifically, *gravitational potential energy* refers to the potential energy an object has due to the gravity of another object.  On Earth, above the ground have gravitational potential energy, because gravity is pulling them down -- they *want* to fall, and thus they want to start moving.  The higher up an object is off the ground, the more it wants to fall, and so it has more potential energy.  This means it has more energy stored up to convert to kinetic energy, and so it will hit the ground going at a faster speed.\n","\n","![Energy](https://static.sciencelearn.org.nz/images/images/000/002/184/full/Potential-and-kinetic-energy20161011-31879-1fyjqa9.jpg \"Energy\")\n","\n","*Potential energy transforming into kinetic energy*\n","\n","In space, gravity doesn't make things fall straight down like they do on Earth.  Instead, gravity makes objects orbit around each other, like Earth and the other planets orbitting around the Sun.  We can write down the formula describing this gravitational potential energy up in space is, for example the gravitational potential energy that causes the Earth to go around the Sun:\n","$${\\rm Gravitational\\ Potential\\ Energy} = \\frac{GM_{\\rm Sun} m_{\\rm Earth}}{r}.$$\n","Here, $M_{\\rm Sun}$ is the mass of the Sun, $m_{\\rm Earth}$ is the mass of the Earth, and $r$ is the distance  between them. $G$ is known as *Newton's Gravitational Constant*, and is just a number that scientists measured that shows up in all of our gravity formulae -- it's basically just a proportionality constant and makes sure our formulae give us the right answer!  This example showcased the potential energy that the Sun invokes on the Earth, but this formula can be applied to any two objects in orbit!  \n","\n","For a big system with multiple components like a galaxy cluster, some additional physics tells us that, if the system is stable (meaning the galaxies in a cluster will stay orbitting around each other within the cluster indefiniteley, and aren't just passing by each other temprorarily), the average kinetic energy of the galaxies can be related to the *potential energy* of the entire system. We can use the following equation to relate the two:\n","$$\n","\\begin{align}\n","\\rm{Kinetic~Energy} &= \\frac{1}{2} {\\rm Gravitational~Potential~Energy} \\\\\n","\\frac{1}{2} m_{\\rm galaxy} v^2 &= \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{GM_{\\rm cluster} m_{\\rm galaxy}}{r} \\\\\n","\\cancel{\\frac{1}{2}} \\cancel{m_{\\rm galaxy}} v^2 &= \\cancel{\\frac{1}{2}} \\frac{GM_{\\rm cluster} \\cancel{m_{\\rm galaxy}}}{r} \\\\\n","v^2 &= \\frac{GM_{\\rm cluster}}{r} \\\\\n","M_{\\rm cluster} &= \\frac{v^2 r}{G}\n","\\end{align}\n","$$\n","So, only with the information on galaxy speeds $v$, and their distances from the center of the cluster $r$ (and knowing the value of the gravitational constant $G$), we can estimate the mass of the entire cluster $M_\\text{cluster}$! And that is exactly what he did. **This number tells us what the mass of the cluster is based on the motion of objects in the system**.\n","\n","But he could measure the mass in a different way; in a high resolution photo of the cluster, he simply counted up the number of individual galaxies that made up the cluster, and multiplied that with the typical mass of a galaxy. **This number tells us what the mass of the cluster is based on the presence of the number of bright objects in the system**.\n","\n","If bright objects like galaxies and their individual stars make up all of matter, then these two estimates of the masses should agree. But, Zwicky found that the ratio of mass due to motion (which he got from our formula above) versus mass due to light (which he got from counting up all the galaxies he could see) is $500$!  Now, his calculation was a bit off, because we didn't know one of the very important numbers required for his calculation back in the '30s.  The true value of this ratio is 8.3, using modern measurements.  This means, there is 8.3 times more matter than we can actually see!  This is known as the *missing mass problem*.\n","\n","Thus, the only thing that could explain such fast motion of galaxies in the Coma Cluster would be the existence of matter that is much more prominent in the Coma Cluster, but does not emit any light. He named this *dark* matter, *dunkle Materie*. Can you guess, what *dunkle* means in English?\n","\n","**Bibliography:**\n","\n","<sup>1</sup> https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1970ApJ...159..379R/abstract\n","\n","<sup>2</sup> https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1933AcHPh...6..110Z/abstract\n","\n","<sup>3</sup> [translation of Zwicky's paper](http://spiff.rit.edu/classes/phys440/lectures/gal_clus/zwicky_ratio.gif \"Zwicky paper\")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"d928009d","metadata":{"id":"d928009d"},"source":["## So what is Dark Matter?"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"b516f0b6","metadata":{"id":"b516f0b6"},"source":["So what does modern-day cosmology and astronomy tell us about dark matter?\n","\n","Dark matter is defined as a type of matter that interacts with itself and regular matter (also known as *baryonic matter*) only with the force of gravity; it is not known to respond to any other forces of nature -- not electricity, not magnetism, and not nuclear forces. Thus, electromagnetic waves, which are what makeup light, do not interact with dark matter, and so we cannot see it.\n","\n","The general picture is that $\\sim 80\\%$ of the matter in the Universe is dark matter, and all of us, our entire Earth, the Solar System, our Galaxy, in fact, all the visible matter in the Universe, only account for $\\sim 20\\%$. All the structure we see in the Universe started thanks to tiny clumps of dark matter that slowly dragged baryonic matter towards them through gravity and start the process of birthing stars and galaxies.\n","\n","But how can we understand dark matter if it is not at all visible? More importantly, how can we understand its theoretical properties to decipher the mysteries of the Universe? One way is by assuming some hypothesis about dark matter, use the existing knowledge of physics to predict how your hypothesized dark matter would interact with regular matter, and then compare your predictions with real observations.\n","\n","And today we will practice the second part of this chain, which is figuring out how to predict the interaction between a mathematical model of dark matter and regular matter with the help of simulations."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"190a1b7f-70c6-407c-a4bf-a51dbcfc6fa3","metadata":{"id":"190a1b7f-70c6-407c-a4bf-a51dbcfc6fa3"},"source":["## Why do I need Simulations?"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"ddf64360-091a-445e-9aca-bc37d82fb177","metadata":{"id":"ddf64360-091a-445e-9aca-bc37d82fb177"},"source":["For the most simple cases, we can write down equations of how different objects will interact with each other and we can then compare numbers coming from these equations with actual experiments to test whether that hypothesis is correct or not.

In fact, almost all physics lessons you learn in school can be tested this way.\n","\n","However, complex (more than two objects) and dynamic (objects moving around) systems often cannot be described by simple equations. But we may nevertheless want to understand how real complex systems work, e.g., how a galaxy of billions of stars grow over time. In such cases, the best we can do is take the simple rules we have and apply them repetitively to *simulate* how the simple rules interact with each other over time.\n","\n","So in this example it might be impossible to write down one equation that explains how a galaxy is evolving. We could instead write computer programs that can calculate how a star's orbit is affected by its neighboring stars, keep track of the information for every star, and then in aggregate we will have a prediction for how a galaxy made up of those stars will change.\n","\n","You could maybe argue with a friend that you think gravity is the only force that affects a galaxy so in your program you only keep the equations of gravity but do not include any equations for electricity or magnetism. But maybe your friend thinks both are important so they include both sets of equations. So now, the two of you have two different hypotheses about a complex system (the galaxy) and we can compare the results of both of your programs with actual data to figure out who is correct!
