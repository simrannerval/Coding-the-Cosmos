These are some of the oldest stars in the universe and therefore must have formed a long time ago.\n","\n","These collections of stars are incredibly useful to astronomers. It can be assumed that all the stars in a cluster formed at around the same time. Stars form when gigantic clouds of molecular gas (clouds that are cool enough that they are mostly made of molecules as opposed to ions) condense gravitationally. Since all of the stars in a globular cluster formed from the same gas cloud, it can be assumed they formed around the same time and are all approximately the same age. These stars were not all identical though, having different masses varying from stars of similar mass to our Sun to stars that over one hundred times more massive. Thus we can use this collection of similar aged stars of different masses to see how different stars evolve!\n","\n","As you will learn in this activity, we can use the evolution of stars in globular clusters to figure out the age of the cluster. The age of globular clusters poses an interesting conclusion for astronomers. Since the large and dense molecular gas clouds that the stars in globular cluster form from were only found in the early universe, when galaxies were still forming, we know that globular clusters must have formed in the early universe as well. This means that globular clusters are a way astronomers can estimate the age of the universe. Expanding on this idea, since the universe cannot be younger than globular clusters, the ages of globular clusters put a lower limit on the age of the universe!\n","\n","In this activity, you will learn the process of using stellar evolution to estimate the age of globular clusters. This process will be done for globular cluster M92 as an example and to provide information about the process for determining the ages. After, you will do this for two additional globular clusters: M22 and Pal 5! At the end of the activity, you will use these three globular cluster age estimates to put a lower limit on the age of the universe.\n","\n","Source: [ESA/Hubble]( https://esahubble.org/wordbank/globular-cluster/#:~:text=Globular%20clusters%20are%20stable%2C%20tightly,and%20are%20tightly%20gravitationally%20bound. )"],"metadata":{"id":"1OcVorHXWvNU"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Getting Data\n","\n","We will be using data from the Gaia mission.

Parallax uses only simple trigonometry (triangle geometry)! It is just the fact that an object looks displaced when it is viewed from a different point of view. To show this to yourself, hold your thumb out at arms length and look at it through only one eye. Then switch eyes, and the postion of your thumb changes. That angle over which it changes is parallax!

Plotted with a measure of the star's luminosity (a measure of brightness; also referred to as absolute magnitude) on the Y axis and its temperature (also known as stellar classifications or surface temperature) on the X axis, the HR diagram provides a plethora of information about stars. The X axis often also shows the colour of the stars; this is because the colour of the star is related to its temperature! The bluer the star the hotter it is; the redder the star the cooler it is.\n","\n","Where a star falls on this plot details certain properties, including its age and where it is in its lifecycle. In Figure 8, the diagonal line across the centre of the plot is called the main-sequence; this is where most stars spend the majority of their life. Stars on the main-sequence are undergoing hydrogen fusion at their cores. Once the hydrogen at their core is depleted, something interesting happens to them: the outer layers begin to cool off but they also become much brighter. This is because they no longer have the \"fuel\" to keep burning like during the main part of their life so they get cooler, but subsequently the outer layers expand away from the core. Since the brightness of the star corresponds to the surface area, the brightness also increases! What this means for their position on the HR diagram is that they will \"turn off\" the main-sequence and move towards other \"branches\" of the diagram (i.e. giants and supergiants). The progression of a star \"turning off\" the main-sequence and moving into the giants or supergiants \"branch\" happens at a very specific time in the star's evolution. For lower mass stars (like our Sun), it takes much longer for them to deplete the hydrogen at their core; this means, it will take them much longer to \"turn off\" the main-sequence. Conversely, higher mass stars deplete their hydrogen quickly and will \"turn off\" the main-sequence at a much younger age than their low-mass counterparts.\n","\n","Since in globular clusters all the stars are approximately the same age but have various sizes, we can plot the population of stars on an HR diagram to see which stars have \"turned off\" the main-sequence and indicate a turnoff point (where the stars start to \"turn off\" the main-sequence) for the globular cluster. Since we know that a star of a given mass will \"turn off\" the main-sequence at a very specific age, we can use this turnoff point of the globular cluster to determine the age of the entire cluster.\n","\n","For example, if a cluster has a turnoff point around temperature 30000K, the age of the cluster would be < 40 million years, as per Table 2.\n","Similarly, given a turnoff point around the F class stars (with temperature on the X axis around 6000K), the age of the cluster would be between 5.1 to 9.3 billion years.\n","\n","Note that all temperatures here are in Kelvin (K), which is related to Celcius via: 0 °C + 273.15 = 273.15 K\n","\n","---\n","\n","<div>\n","<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daniellamorrone/daniellamorrone.github.io/main/images/ms.png\" width=\"400\"/>\n","</div>\n","\n","**Figure (8)**.

Stars and other astronomical objects emit energy that is received by our instruments as light. This light can be split into different colours (like shining a white light at a glass prism and it splitting into a rainbow! See Figure 9). These different colours represent different wavelengths of light. The range of wavelengths that an object can emit light in is from before infrared (beyond red) to past ultraviolet (beyond violet), and where this light from the object is most powerful or has interesting characteristics tells us a lot about the object. The brightness -- and consequently the magnitude -- of an object at a specific wavelength is essentially how powerful the light is at that wavelength. Moreover, there are two types of magnitudes: absolute magnitude and apparent magnitude. Absolute magnitude is a measure of the brightness intrinsic to the object; this is effectively how much light/energy is being emitted from the object. Apparent magnitude is a measure of the brightness at which we observe the object; this measure is the value we get from our telescopes and can be used to find the absolute magnitude by accommodating for the distance of the object.\n","\n","---\n","<div>\n","<img src=\"https://all-about-light.weebly.com/uploads/2/0/3/2/20328131/6516821.jpeg?341\" width=\"500\"/>\n","</div>\n","\n","**Figure (9)**.

But what is the G-R colour?\n","\n","When telescopes detect light from an object, they look at different colours of light by applying different filters onto the telescope that only look at wavelenghts around the colour (this is a wavelength band); to look at green, they put a green filter that only looks at the green band wavelenghts; to look at red, the put a red band filter. However, these measurements of the light at different colour bands don't mean much on their own. But comparing two of these colour band measurements will tell you whether an object tends to one colour or another, and that can tell you much more about the object!\n","\n","To compare the two colours, you take the brightness detected at one colour band and subtract it from the brightness at the other colour band. So, for the sake of our HR diagram, we are looking at the G-R colour. This is the difference in the brightness of the stars with a green band filter and with a red band filter (hence, the G and R!). This difference indicates whether the light from a star is more green (lower G-R number) or more red (higher G-R number)*. This \"more green or more red\" value is an indicator of the star's colour, which is related to the star's temperature, and will be used on the X axis of our HR diagram.\n","\n","**Yes, this is inverted from what it seems intuitively!
