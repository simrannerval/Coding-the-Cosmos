It allows us to organize our code into separate components. They are a way of converting complicated lists of tasks into a simple one line input. They are used very frequently by astronomers to save time and make our code cleaner. Functions in Python are defined using the ``def`` keyword, followed by the function name and parentheses containing optional input parameters. Functions can return a value or set of values, think of them as input-output machines. When a function is called, it will do everything inside its \"block\" and spit out whatever the return command has in it. Functions enable the division of complex tasks into smaller, manageable parts. They promote code reuse, as functions can be called multiple times with different arguments.\n","\n","Notice that the description of the function is in two sets of ``'''``, this is known as a doc string.

It has something to do with how Python access and stores data in the computer. When we define \"number1\" and \"number2\" there are stored in specific locations in computer memory known as \"loc\". When we define sum, Python asks the computer to \"add the item at location 14 and the item at location 72\". This is now set to be the defenition of the variable \"sum\". If we were to redefine \"number2\", then nothing changes in sum. It still accesses the two locations in memory which we previously asked it too. When we ask Python, ``print(sum)`` it simply prints those locations. Hence we get the wrong answer. If we want to print the correct answer, we must redefine sum. Then we are telling Python \"no don't add the values of the numbers at location 14 and location 72, instead add the values of the numbers at location 14 and location 51.
